        //What is Hashing Technique
        /*Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a
        hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends
        on the efficiency of the hash function used.

        Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example
        if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5}
        in the array or Hash table respectively.

        hash collision -> when collision occurred we use the open addressing or chaining
        to handle collisions.

        loading factor ->  The number of elements in a hash table divided by the number
        of slots. Usually written Î± (alpha)

        Classes ->
        1.HashMap
        2.HashSet
        3.Linked HashMap
        4.Hash Table

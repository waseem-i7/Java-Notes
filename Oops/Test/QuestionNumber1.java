    /*
       Answer : Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that
       it is designed to use objects and classes to structure code and provide reusable,
       modular components.

      In object-oriented programming, a program is organized into objects, which are
      instances of classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties
      and methods of an object, while an object is an instance of a class that has its own
      state and behavior.

      Java's support for object-oriented programming includes features such as encapsulation,
      inheritance,abstraction  and polymorphism. Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal
      details of an object from the outside world, while inheritance allows classes to inherit
      properties and methods from other classes. Polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms and
      be used in different ways, depending on the context.

     Java also supports interfaces, which are abstract classes that define a set of methods
     that a class must implement. Interfaces provide a way to define a contract between a
     class and the code that uses it, allowing for more modular and flexible code.

    Overall, Java's object-oriented programming features make it a powerful language for
    building complex, modular, and reusable software systems.
